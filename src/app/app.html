<!-- * * * * * * * * * * * (directive) RouterOutlet
@description
Acts as a placeholder that Angular dynamically fills based on the current router state.

Each outlet can have a unique name, determined by the optional name attribute. The name cannot be set or changed dynamically. If not set, default value is "primary".

<router-outlet></router-outlet>
<router-outlet name='left'></router-outlet>
<router-outlet name='right'></router-outlet>
Named outlets can be the targets of secondary routes. The Route object for a secondary route has an outlet property to identify the target outlet:

{path: <base-path>, component: <component>, outlet: <target_outlet_name>}

Using named outlets and secondary routes, you can target multiple outlets in the same RouterLink directive.

The router keeps track of separate branches in a navigation tree for each named outlet and generates a representation of that tree in the URL. The URL for a secondary route uses the following syntax to specify both the primary and secondary routes at the same time:

http://base-path/primary-route-path(outlet-name:route-path)

A router outlet emits an activate event when a new component is instantiated, deactivate event when a component is destroyed. An attached event emits when the RouteReuseStrategy instructs the outlet to reattach the subtree, and the detached event emits when the RouteReuseStrategy instructs the outlet to detach the subtree.

<router-outlet
  (activate)='onActivate($event)'
  (deactivate)='onDeactivate($event)'
  (attach)='onAttach($event)'
  (detach)='onDetach($event)'></router-outlet>
